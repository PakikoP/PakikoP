#Now!

##### I am a multidisciplinary professional who integrates psychology, urbanism, architecture, art, and technology to address urban issues and foster public engagement in the transformation of cities. My expertise includes designing and activating public spaces, developing innovative methodologies to rethink urban life, and exploring the reciprocity between human and non-human ecosystems. As a co-founder of dérive lab, I have led impactful projects that combine research, creativity, and community engagement, successfully securing grants and resources through partnerships with international agencies, non-profit organizations, and government entities. I hold degrees in social psychology and urbanism from Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), and Universidad de Lleida.
